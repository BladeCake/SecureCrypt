# SecureCrypt
A small weekend project I made. It is a very basic password manager for any non-important information you want to secure.

######################

To run the program is very simple, just double click the 'SecureCrypt v1.0' shortcut in the 'SecureCrypt v1.0' file.
You can aslo place this shortcut on your desktop for easier access.
